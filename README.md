# Automation scripts for studying C
A couple of simple bash scripts that I use when studying C

## setup.sh
Opens a chw.c file I typically use to solve exercises with Sublime Text, opens the books file itself and an official website with solutions to exercises. Also start the 50 minute timer, after each notifies user that it is time to take break.

## run.sh
Compiles and runs chw.c
